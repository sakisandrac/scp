### Learning Goals:
The learning goals for this project were to practice writing HTML, CSS and Javascript and combine them together to make one program. The goal was also to match a given comp as closely as possible while adding features that are in the same style as said comp.

### Wins + Challenges:
This was the first time I built a program from HTML, CSS and Javascript all together with almost no pre-work in the file already. I am really proud of how it turned out. This was also the first time working with a comp and I feel like I matched the style very closely. It was a challenge to build more features on top of what was given to us in the initial picture and style it to be similar, so I am also very pleased with the way this project turned out. The overall displaying of the contents on the page were very challenging at first since I am new to flex box. However, it was much easier to style everything on the page one I wrapped all my contents in "boxes" and used flexbox to move them around the page.
